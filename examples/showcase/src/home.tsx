      <p>
        Welcome to{" "}
        <strong>Ultra</strong>. The little web-framework which has no bundler
        (it's very fast not having to bundle) and ships the same ESM that you
        write (you can do that now in 2022).
      </p>
      <p>
        It gives the big-boy frameworks a run for their VC money. (j/k we would
        really like some too, hit us up on Discord)
      </p>

        This is the homepage. It is static HTML, it ships Zero-JSâ„¢.

        Can you please do us a favour and open your network tab and refresh this
        page?
