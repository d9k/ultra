Welp, if you've made it here, you probably have a basic **Ultra** project
running...

**Ultra** gives you the control to use (or not use) many of the most popular
React libraries out there. Use the examples above as a guide, you will probably
need to update your `importMap.json` `server.tsx` and `client.tsx`

Your app will probably need --

**`Routing`, choose from:**

- Wouter (with-wouter)
- React Router (with-react-router)

**`Data Fetching`:**

- React Query (with-react-query)
- tRPC (with-trpc)

**`CSS Styling`:**

- Emotion (with-emotion)
- Stitches (with-stitches)
- Twind (with-twind)

or just use plain old CSS, it's _way_ underrated.

**`Head Management`:**

- React Helmet Async (with-react-helmet-async)

**`API Routing`:** (with-api-routes)

---

If there is an existing library that you want to use, there is a good chance you
can create a custom integration. Use some of the examples above as a guide --
open a PR if you are keen.
